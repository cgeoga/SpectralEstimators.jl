# SpectralEstimators.jl

This package provides tools for scalably and accurate evaluating the
log-likelihood of a Gaussian time series using its spectral density. It is the
software companion to [Fast Machine-Precision Spectral Likelihoods for
Stationary Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16583). 

A complete README is coming soon!
